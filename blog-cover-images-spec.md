## Design Tools Recommendations:

### AI Image Generation Tools:
1. **Midjourney** - Best for abstract, artistic visualizations
   - Prompts: "abstract neural network visualization, red and black gradient, code particles, professional tech aesthetic"
   
2. **DALL-E 3** - Good for precise control
   - Can generate specific geometric patterns and layouts
   
3. **Stable Diffusion** - Open source, highly customizable
   - Good for technical/abstract concepts

### Design Software:
1. **Figma** - Best for precise control and brand consistency
   - Create custom gradients, shapes, and effects
   - Easy to export optimized images
   
2. **Canva Pro** - Quick creation with templates
   - Good for text overlays and basic effects
   
3. **Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop** - Professional control
   - Best for custom graphics and effects

### Recommended Workflow:
1. Generate base abstract visualization using AI tool
2. Import into Figma/Canva
3. Add brand colors and gradients
4. Add text overlay with proper typography
5. Apply 20% dark gradient overlay from top
6. Optimize and export as WebP (under 200KB)

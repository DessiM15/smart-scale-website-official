- Geometric patterns suggesting intelligence and connectivity
- Dark black background (#000000) with red accent gradients
- Professional, enterprise-appropriate aesthetic
- No robots, human faces, or literal brain graphics
- Abstract and sophisticated design
- Dimensions: 1920x1080px
- Style: Modern tech, clean, professional
```

### Stable Diffusion Prompt:
```
abstract neural network, interconnected nodes, red gradient connections #DC2626, code particles floating, matrix code rain subtle, geometric hexagonal patterns, dark black background #000000, professional tech aesthetic, enterprise design, particles data streams, modern minimalist, cinematic lighting, high detail, 1920x1080, 16:9 aspect ratio
Negative prompt: robots, human faces, brain graphics, stock photos, cheesy designs

- Building blocks or modular components coming together
- Subtle upward trajectory suggesting growth (not cartoonish)
- Wireframe transitioning to more polished design
- Red accent color (#DC2626) against black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) base
- Subtle grid or blueprint patterns in background
- Floating abstract UI elements (blurred, low opacity)
- Clean, aspirational, startup-meets-enterprise aesthetic
- No literal product boxes, people coding, or cluttered designs
- Dimensions: 1920x1080px
- Style: Modern, clean, professional
```

### Stable Diffusion Prompt:
```
minimalist iterative development, abstract spiral progression, building blocks assembling, subtle rocket trajectory, wireframe to finished product, red accent #DC2626, black white base, grid blueprint pattern, floating UI elements abstract, startup enterprise aesthetic, clean aspirational, professional, 1920x1080, 16:9
Negative prompt: product boxes, people coding, cluttered designs, cartoonish elements
```

## BLOG POST 3: "The Hidden Costs of Offshore Development"

### Midjourney Prompt:
```
abstract geometric iceberg concept visualization, top 20% visible lighter, bottom 80% hidden darker with red accents, simplified world map silhouette with connection lines showing timezone complexity, overlapping clock faces abstract, subtle dollar signs transforming, broken communication lines, dark background #000000 with red glow effects #DC2626, data-driven analytical infographic style, professional warning aesthetic, 1920x1080, dramatic lighting --style raw --ar 16:9
```

### DALL-E 3 / ChatGPT Prompt:
```
Create a sophisticated, data-driven visualization showing hidden costs concept. The image should feature:
- Abstract geometric iceberg (not literal) - top 20% visible (lighter), bottom 80% hidden (darker with red accents)
- Simplified world map silhouette with connection lines showing timezone complexity
- Overlapping abstract clock faces representing different time zones
- Subtle dollar sign elements transforming/multiplying (not tacky)
- Broken connection lines showing communication breakdown
- Dark black background (#000000) with red accent lighting (#DC2626)
- Professional infographic aesthetic - analytical, warning without fear-mongering
- No stereotypical imagery of specific countries or people
- Dimensions: 1920x1080px
- Style: Data-driven, sophisticated, professional
```

### Stable Diffusion Prompt:
```
abstract geometric iceberg concept, visible hidden costs visualization, world map silhouette connection lines, timezone complexity, overlapping clock faces abstract, dollar signs transforming subtle, broken communication lines, dark background #000000, red glow effects #DC2626, data-driven infographic style, analytical professional, dramatic lighting, 1920x1080, 16:9
Negative prompt: stereotypical country imagery, people, fear-mongering, tacky designs
```

## Post-Processing Instructions:

After generating the base images, you'll need to:

1. **Add Text Overlay:**
   - Import image into Figma or Canva
   - Add title text in Montserrat or Inter Bold font
   - Position in bottom third, left-aligned with 60px padding
   - Use white (#FFFFFF) text color
   - Add subtle text shadow for readability

2. **Add Dark Gradient Overlay:**
   - Apply 20% dark gradient overlay from top
   - This ensures text readability

3. **Optimize:**
   - Export as WebP (preferred) or JPEG
   - Target file size: Under 200KB
   - Quality: 85-90%
   - Dimensions: 1920x1080px

4. **File Naming:**
   - `blog-1-ai-revolutionizing-software-development.webp`
   - `blog-2-why-business-needs-mvp-first.webp`
   - `blog-3-hidden-costs-offshore-development.webp`

## Quick Tips:

- **Iterate:** Generate multiple variations and choose the best
- **Refine:** Use image editing tools to adjust colors to match brand exactly
- **Test:** Check text readability on both desktop and mobile
- **Optimize:** Compress images while maintaining quality
- **Consistency:** Ensure all three images have similar visual weight and style
